# Space Invaders

A small arcade game inspired by the classic **Space Invaders**, implemented in **C** using **raylib**.

## Overview

You control a ship at the bottom of the screen and shoot at waves of alien invaders. The game demonstrates simple mechanics such as movement, shooting, collision detection, and basic enemy behavior.

## Features
- Moving enemies  
- Simple controls: move left/right and shoot  
- Minimalistic, retro-style graphics (currently, only circles spawn circles to destroy circles xD)  
- Easy to build and run (Linux only)  

## Requirements
- Linux  
- C compiler (gcc)  
- raylib included as a static library in the `lib` directory  

## TODO
- Replace placeholder graphics
(circles) with proper sprites for player, enemies, and bullets  
- Add sound effects for shooting, enemy hits, and game over
- Add particles when an asteroid is destroyed

## Installation and Running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notorious1dev/space-invaders.git
cd space-invaders
./start.sh
```
